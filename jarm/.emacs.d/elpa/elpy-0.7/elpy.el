;;; Commentary:

;; The Emacs Lisp Python Environment in Emacs

;; Emacs has excellent Python support through a number of packages.
;; The only problem is that every user needs to set up all of these
;; packages to work nicely with each other. This mode does not a lot
;; more than to combine those packages and give them a default
;; configuration for Python.

;; Features include:

;; - Code completion (using auto-complete and rope)
;;   Emacs will suggest completions as you type and, after a short
;;   delay, pop up a select box with proposed completions, including
;;   docstrings for those completions when available.

;; - Indentation highlighting (using highlight-indentation)
;;   Highlight indentation levels in code so you can always see which
;;   code belongs where.

;; - Snippet Expansion (using yasnippet and auto-complete)
;;   Some completion options are highlighted and will expand into full
;;   code snippets that you just need to fill out.

;; - Code hinting (using eldoc and rope)
;;   While you write, the minibuffer will show the call signature of
;;   the current function.

;; - Code Navigation (using rope and python.el)
;;   Quickly jump to the definition of a function or class, find
;;   callers of the current function, or browse all definitions in the
;;   current file. `find-file-at-point' will also find module source
;;   files from import statements.

;; - Inline Documentation (using rope)
;;   Read the help() output of the object at point with a quick key
;;   shortcut.

;; - On-the-fly checks (using flymake)
;;   Highlight errors in your code while you edit it.

;; - Virtualenv support (using pyvirtualenv)
;;   Use C-c C-e to activate a virtual environment thorough your Emacs
;;   and for subprocesses. Use C-u C-c C-e to disable a virtual
;;   environment.

;; - Python web documentation
;;   Simply access the Python web documentation using a tab-completed
;;   list of modules and objects.

;; - Refactoring (using rope)
;;   Use any of multiple powerful refactoring tools, such extracting
;;   the region to a variable or a separate function, renaming
;;   identifiers, modules or packages, or just automatically clean up
;;   your imports.

;; - Easy IPython support for those who use it
;;   Simply run (elpy-use-ipython).

;; Setup:

;; Add the following to your .emacs:

;; (package-initialize)
;; (elpy-enable)

;; To use on-the-fly highlighting of errors and for the code check
;; command, you need to set `python-check-command' to a command you
;; have installed. Any combination of pyflakes, pep8 and pylint are
;; useful, and all available via easy_install and pip. Also see the
;; python-check.sh utility from the same repository as this file to
;; use all of them at once.

;; (setq python-check-command "python-check.sh")

;; If you want to use IPython (make sure it's installed), add:

;; (elpy-use-ipython)

;; If you find the (Python Elpy yas AC Rope ElDoc Fill) mode line
;; annoying, also add:

;; (elpy-clean-modeline)

;;; Code:

;; Some global variables. Need to be set before the other modes are
;; loaded, as some of them define some silly global keys without these
;; set. We are using `defvar' to avoid overwriting a user's
;; configuration, if any.

(defvar flymake-no-changes-timeout 60
  "Time to wait after last change before starting compilation.

The original value of 0.5 is too short for Python code, as that
will result in the current line to be highlighted most of the

but at least it does not, in general, interfere with normal
interaction.

Value set by elpy.")

(defvar flymake-start-syntax-check-on-newline nil
  "Start syntax check if newline char was added/removed from the buffer.

a file on which the rope command is performed when no project is
already opened.

(defvar ropemacs-confirm-saving nil

(defvar ac-trigger-key "TAB"

If you specify this TAB, for example, `auto-complete' will start by typing TAB,
and if there is no completions, an original command will be fallbacked.

Value set by elpy.")

(defvar ac-auto-show-menu 0.4
  "Non-nil means completion menu will be automatically shown.

Value set by elpy.")

(defvar ac-quick-help-delay 0.5
  "Delay to show quick help.

This value should be greater than `ac-auto-show-menu' to show
help for the first entry as well.

Value set by elpy.")

(defvar yas/trigger-key (kbd "C-c C-p C-s")
  "The key bound to `yas-expand' when `yas-minor-mode' is active.

Value is a string that is converted to the internal Emacs key
representation using `read-kbd-macro'.

Value set by elpy.")

Manual installation:

First, the easy ones. Please run the following command in a
shell:

  easy_install --user rope ropemode ropemacs

If you do not have easy_install, pip might be available:

  pip install --user rope ropemode ropemacs

The last missing module is Pymacs, which is sadly not available
via easy_install. You will need to run the following:

  git clone https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs.git
  cd Pymacs
  make
  python setup.py install --user

Try loading elpy again once that is done. Everything should work
then."))))
